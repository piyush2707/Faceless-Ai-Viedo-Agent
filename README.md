# ComfyUI Workflow Project

A custom ComfyUI workflow for AI image generation and manipulation.

## Workflow Overview

![Workflow Diagram](workflow.png)

This workflow demonstrates a complete pipeline for AI-powered image generation using ComfyUI's node-based interface.

## Features

- **Input/Voice Topic**: Flexible input handling for generation prompts
- **Generate Prompts**: Automated prompt generation system
- **Generate Images**: Multi-stage image generation pipeline
- **Generate Values**: Dynamic value computation for enhanced control
- **Generate Sounds**: Audio generation capabilities
- **Output/Final Value**: Structured output delivery
- **Publishing Agent**: Automated publishing and distribution

## Prerequisites

Before running this workflow, ensure you have:

- ComfyUI installed and properly configured
- Required custom nodes (if any)
- Necessary model files downloaded
- Python 3.10 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Place the workflow JSON file in your ComfyUI workflows directory:
```bash
cp workflow.json /path/to/ComfyUI/workflows/
```

3. Install any required custom nodes (check the custom_nodes folder)

4. Download required models and place them in appropriate directories

## Usage

1. Open ComfyUI in your browser
2. Load the workflow from the workflows directory
3. Configure input parameters as needed
4. Click "Queue Prompt" to execute the workflow
5. Monitor the generation process in real-time
6. Access outputs in the designated output folder

## Workflow Components

### Input Processing
Handles initial input and voice topic configuration for the generation pipeline.

### Prompt Generation
Automatically generates optimized prompts based on input parameters.

### Image Generation
Multi-stage image generation with fine-tuned control over quality and style.

### Value Generation
Computes dynamic values for enhanced generation control.

### Sound Generation
Produces audio outputs synchronized with visual content.

### Publishing
Automated publishing agent for streamlined content distribution.

## Configuration

Edit the workflow parameters within ComfyUI's interface or modify the JSON file directly for advanced customization.
